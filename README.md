## Overview

We used an age-structured model fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admission data to investigate the impact of vaccination on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal.

All details are described in the preprint

> XXX

### Data 

The data was added to the ``` data ``` folder for convenience.

### Seroprevalence data

The seroprevalence data has been published at:

> Kislaya I, GonÃ§alves P, Barreto M, Sousa R, Garcia AC, Matos R, Guiomar R, Rodrigues AP; ISNCOVID-19 Group. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Portugal in May-July 2020: Results of the First National Serological Survey (ISNCOVID-19). Acta Med Port. 2021 Feb 1;34(2):87-94. doi: 10.20344/amp.15122. Epub 2021 Feb 1. PMID: 33641702.

### Contact matrices

The unperturbed contact matrix and the school contact matrix are from the publication:

The lockdown contact matrix was extrapolated from the publication:

### Demographic data

We used publicly available [data](https://www.pordata.pt/Portugal/Popula%C3%A7%C3%A3o+residente++m%C3%A9dia+anual+total+e+por+grupo+et%C3%A1rio-10) from the Contemporary Portugal Database (PORDATA) : https://www.pordata.pt/.

### Hospitalization data

The hospitalization data was shared by a DGS collaborator and is not avaiable for public distribution. ***???***

## Model

### Inference

Model inference was done with *R version 3.6.0* using *R Studio Version 1.3.1056* (Interface to *R*) and Stan using *rstan* *R* package version 2.21.1 (*R* interface to *Stan*) and *cmdstanr* *R* package Version 0.1.3 on *Windows 10 Home Version 2004*.

The scripts can be found in the ``` scripts ``` directory. The R and Stan scripts are based on scripts used for the publication :

Estimating Transmission Parameters for Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Predicting the Impact of Maternal and Pediatric Vaccination. J Infect Dis. 2020 Oct 7;222(Supplement_7):S688-S694. doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa424 

### Analysis

Analysis of the model was performed on a *Mac OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5* and *Windows 10 Home Version 2004* using *Mathematica Version Number 12.1.0.0*. 

The notebook XXXXXXXXX.nb, where the analysis was performed, can be found in the ```notebooks``` directory.

### Figures

Figures for the manuscript were produced in the notebook XXXXXXXXX.nb. Figures can be found in the ```figures``` directory.

### Output

Output files produced in *R* or *Mathematica* can be found in the ```output``` directory.

## Other

### OS requirements

This package is supported for *macOS*, *Windows 10* and *Linux* (altought I didnt test it i think it is possible to run it) . The package has been tested on:

- Windows 10 Home Version 2004
- Mac OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5

### Hardware requirements

Our study requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

## Installation guide

Dependencies:

- R Version 3.6.0 https://www.r-project.org/
- R Studio Version 1.3.1056 (Interface to R) https://rstudio.com/
- rstan R package Version 2.21.1 (R interface to Stan) https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/vignettes/rstan.html
- cmdstanr R package Version 0.1.3 on Windows 10 Home Version 2004 https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/
- Mathematica 12.1.0.0 https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/
- [*Windows 10*] RTools40
- [*Windows 10*] Git Bash

If you use *Windows* you probably need *RTools40* and/or *Git Bash* to be able to compile the model.

After all the dependencies are installed it is necessary to change the directories in the *XXXXXXXX.R* file so that the *R Studio* finds all the necessary files. 

Once that is done you only need to sequentially run the code from the start.

If *cmdstanr* was installed correctly the line below should create an executable in the working directory. The compilation should take a couple of minutes.

``` sm <- cmdstan_model(stan_model_file) ```

The following line is where the fitting is done. Depending on the precision, number of iterations, etc, it can take from minutes to weeks to complete the fitting.

```
fit <- sm$sample(
  (...)
)
```

To save the fit done run:

```
save(fit.rstan, file = "output/my_fit.rda")
```

To export the parameters found in the fit into a *.csv* file run:

```
write.csv(output, file = "output/my_parameters.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
